#### b. Project abstract
COVID-19 has become the hot issue all around the world for 2 years, and it could even be longer.
Before our doctors and scientists could find a complete treatment / vaccine, the battle against this pandemic
still relies on the majority of ordinary people to prevent its spread at the first place. Our team identifies
information as the key area to improve. There are many times that we could witness a massive panic created by false
information in this senstitive time. A place with a lot of accessilble and reliable information, where the user 
could search, retrieve, and save information as how they like is the target of our project. Covid-19 Intelligent
Query System (Covid-19 IQS) was born from this idea
