#### b. Project abstract
As the fight against COVID-19 continues, it is critical to discover and accumulate knowledge in scientific literature to combat the pandemic. In this work, we shared the experience in developing an intelligent query system on COVID-19 literature.  The system includes a text-based search engine using Elasticsearch for users to query the COVID-19 literature database. We also collect users' interactions and feedbacks to research user needs and improve our search algorithms with learning to rank techniques. The successful implementation of the COVID-IQS can support knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation in our institution and can be shared with other institutions to make a broader impact.
