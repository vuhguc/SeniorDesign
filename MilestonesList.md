* Milestones:
1) (December 1th 2021): Finish all HTML static design
    - This design phase will receive design from our dedicated graphic designer and convert it into a static HTML design by one of our team members. This HTML being static means the HTML files will temporarily hold hardocoded data for the sake of demonstration rather than actual and dynamic data
2) (January 15th 2022): Complete the backend logic for elastic search
    - The elastic search should be able to do the searching by keyword, by id, and by concept
3) (February 12th 2022): Integrate the backend logic into HTML design
    - We expect after this step, the HTML design now will be able to render the actual and dynamic data (such as repositories / projects) using the backend logic
* Deliverables:
    - A full, complete, functional, and well-designed web application. The user should be able to login using their UC6+2, search for his/her wanted articles, interacts with their repositories and peers.
